* Citation: (2024) 5 SCC 123
* Full Legal Case Text (Narrative):
   The plaintiff, Ms. Ananya Sharma, a former senior software engineer at TechSolutions Inc., filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and gender-based discrimination. Ms. Sharma’s complaint details a pattern of being passed over for promotions in favor of less experienced male colleagues, despite consistently exceeding performance metrics. The suit further claims that her termination in April 2024 was retaliatory, occurring shortly after she raised concerns about salary disparities and lack of female representation in leadership roles to the HR department. TechSolutions Inc. argues that Ms. Sharma's termination was due to a company-wide restructuring and performance deficiencies, citing internal review scores that Ms. Sharma disputes as subjective and biased. The company has presented email correspondence indicating performance warnings, which Ms. Sharma contends were manufactured post-hoc to justify her dismissal.
   The core of the dispute revolves around the interpretation of internal performance review policies and the validity of discrimination claims under Indian labor laws. Ms. Sharma seeks significant compensatory damages, reinstatement, and a public apology. TechSolutions Inc. is preparing a robust defense, emphasizing its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and providing evidence of similar restructuring efforts impacting other employees. The legal team for TechSolutions Inc. is particularly concerned about the precedent this case could set regarding internal HR investigations and the subjective nature of performance evaluations.
   Discovery is currently underway, with both parties demanding extensive documentation, including internal HR records, performance reviews of Ms. Sharma and her male counterparts, and communication logs related to the restructuring. The case has attracted media attention due to its focus on gender discrimination in the tech industry, adding pressure on both sides to reach a favorable outcome. Initial mediation attempts have failed, indicating a strong likelihood of the case proceeding to trial.

* Full Legal Case Text (Narrative):
   Gupta Enterprises, a construction firm, has filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the National Bank of India. The dispute arises from a delayed disbursement of a project finance loan sanctioned for a large-scale infrastructure project. Gupta Enterprises alleges that the bank’s failure to disburse funds by the agreed-upon date led to significant project delays, increased material costs, and penalties imposed by the project owner, a government agency. The contract stipulated a clear timeline for fund release contingent upon certain milestones, which Gupta Enterprises claims were met. The bank, however, asserts that Gupta Enterprises failed to provide all necessary documentation for compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and internal risk assessment protocols, thus justifying the delay.
   The primary legal issue revolves around the interpretation of the loan agreement’s conditions precedent for disbursement and the extent to which regulatory compliance obligations supersede contractual timelines.

The National Bank of India is contending that its actions were prudent and in line with its fiduciary duties and regulatory mandates, aiming to limit its liability to the actual funds disbursed, if any, rather than consequential damages.
   Evidence includes the loan agreement, correspondence between the parties, project progress reports, and documentation requests from the bank. The potential for a large claim for consequential damages poses a significant risk for the bank. The case highlights the tension between contractual obligations and evolving regulatory compliance requirements in the financial sector.

The PIL details the overflowing landfills, inadequate waste segregation, and unauthorized burning of garbage in several city areas, directly violating environmental protection acts and municipal solid waste management rules. EAG has submitted photographic evidence, expert reports on air and water pollution levels, and testimonies from affected residents documenting respiratory illnesses and contamination of local water sources. The Corporation’s defense centers on resource constraints, rapid urban population growth, and ongoing efforts to implement new waste management technologies, which they argue require time.

EAG is seeking a court order for immediate implementation of sustainable waste management practices, penalties for non-compliance, and a comprehensive remediation plan. The Corporation is attempting to demonstrate reasonable efforts and seek more time for compliance, while also questioning the scientific rigor of some of EAG’s expert reports.

The RWA claims that several common areas, including the clubhouse and swimming pool, were constructed with substandard materials and deviate significantly from the approved architectural designs, leading to safety concerns and aesthetic dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the RWA alleges that the builder failed to provide promised amenities, such as a dedicated children's play area and a functional rainwater harvesting system, which were explicitly advertised during the sales process.
