Case Name:
Suresh Chandra v. Ministry of Defence

Citation:
(2024) 4 CAT Rep 99

Full Legal Case Text:
Suresh Chandra, a retired army officer, has filed a petition before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) challenging the non-payment of his full pensionary benefits and gratuity, which he claims have been arbitrarily withheld by the Ministry of Defence. Mr. Chandra asserts that despite fulfilling all service requirements and retiring honorably, a portion of his pension and gratuity has been withheld on the grounds of an alleged pending departmental inquiry into a minor procedural lapse from over a decade ago, for which no charges were ever formally framed. The Ministry of Defence contends that the withholding is provisional, pending the finalization of the inquiry process, and is permissible under service rules to safeguard against potential liabilities.
   The primary legal issues involve the interpretation of pension rules and regulations, the doctrine of laches (unreasonable delay in asserting a right), the principles of natural justice in departmental inquiries, and the rights of retired government employees. Mr. Chandra is seeking an immediate release of all withheld benefits with interest. The Ministry is defending its right to conduct inquiries and ensure financial accountability.
   Service records, pension payment orders, and correspondence regarding the alleged inquiry will form the basis of the evidence. The case highlights issues of bureaucratic delays and the impact on the rights of retired personnel.
