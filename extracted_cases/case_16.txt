Case Name:
Sharma Investments Ltd. v. Capital Market Regulators

Citation:
(2023) 1 SEBI App Tribunal 67

Full Legal Case Text:
Sharma Investments Ltd. has appealed against an order from the Capital Market Regulators (CMR), which imposed a significant penalty and suspended its trading license for alleged insider trading activities. CMRâ€™s order is based on an investigation that revealed unusual trading patterns in the shares of a listed company, "FutureTech," just prior to a major corporate announcement, coinciding with contacts between Sharma Investments' key personnel and FutureTech's executives. CMR alleges that Sharma Investments gained illegal profits by acting on unpublished price-sensitive information. Sharma Investments vehemently denies these allegations, arguing that its trading decisions were based on legitimate market research and publicly available information, and that the timing of trades was purely coincidental. They are challenging the statistical analysis used by CMR to establish the "unusual" trading patterns and the sufficiency of evidence to prove insider trading.
   The primary legal issues involve the definition and proof of insider trading, the interpretation of securities regulations, the standard of evidence required for imposing penalties, and the procedural fairness of the investigation. Sharma Investments is seeking to quash the CMR order and restore its trading license. CMR is defending its investigative powers and its role in maintaining market integrity.
   Trading data, communication records (emails, call logs), investigation reports, and expert testimony on market analysis will be crucial. The case has significant implications for market integrity and the enforcement powers of regulatory bodies.

Appellant: Sharma Investments Ltd.; Respondent: Capital Market Regulators.
