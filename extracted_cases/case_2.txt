Case Name:
Sharma v. TechSolutions Inc.

Citation:
(2024) 5 SCC 123

Full Legal Case Text:
The plaintiff, Ms. Ananya Sharma, a former senior software engineer at TechSolutions Inc., filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and gender-based discrimination. Ms. Sharmaâ€™s complaint details a pattern of being passed over for promotions in favor of less experienced male colleagues, despite consistently exceeding performance metrics. The suit further claims that her termination in April 2024 was retaliatory, occurring shortly after she raised concerns about salary disparities and lack of female representation in leadership roles to the HR department. TechSolutions Inc. argues that Ms. Sharma's termination was due to a company-wide restructuring and performance deficiencies, citing internal review scores that Ms. Sharma disputes as subjective and biased. The company has presented email correspondence indicating performance warnings, which Ms. Sharma contends were manufactured post-hoc to justify her dismissal.
   The core of the dispute revolves around the interpretation of internal performance review policies and the validity of discrimination claims under Indian labor laws. Ms. Sharma seeks significant compensatory damages, reinstatement, and a public apology. TechSolutions Inc. is preparing a robust defense, emphasizing its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and providing evidence of similar restructuring efforts impacting other employees. The legal team for TechSolutions Inc. is particularly concerned about the precedent this case could set regarding internal HR investigations and the subjective nature of performance evaluations.
   Discovery is currently underway, with both parties demanding extensive documentation, including internal HR records, performance reviews of Ms. Sharma and her male counterparts, and communication logs related to the restructuring. The case has attracted media attention due to its focus on gender discrimination in the tech industry, adding pressure on both sides to reach a favorable outcome. Initial mediation attempts have failed, indicating a strong likelihood of the case proceeding to trial.

Parties:

Summary:
Ms. Ananya Sharma, a former senior software engineer, has sued TechSolutions Inc. for wrongful termination and gender-based discrimination. She alleges being overlooked for promotions and believes her dismissal in April 2024 was retaliation for raising concerns about gender disparities within the company.
