Case Name:
Dr. Sanjay Mehra v. Apollo Hospitals

Citation:
(2024) 1 NCJC 77

Full Legal Case Text:
Dr. Sanjay Mehra has filed a medical negligence suit against Apollo Hospitals, alleging that a surgical error during a routine appendectomy performed on his son resulted in severe complications and prolonged recovery. Dr. Mehra claims that the operating surgeon, an employee of Apollo Hospitals, failed to properly ligate a vessel, leading to internal bleeding and requiring subsequent corrective surgery. He asserts that the hospital's protocols for surgical checks were not adequately followed and that the post-operative care was deficient, contributing to the escalation of his son's condition. Apollo Hospitals, while expressing regret for the patient's discomfort, denies negligence, arguing that the complication was a known risk of the procedure, not a result of a breach in the standard of care. They contend that all necessary protocols were followed and that the subsequent corrective surgery was handled promptly and competently.
   The primary legal issues involve establishing the standard of medical care, proving a breach of that standard, and demonstrating a direct causal link between the alleged negligence and the patient's injury. Dr. Mehra is seeking substantial compensatory damages for medical expenses, pain and suffering, and loss of future earnings for his son. Apollo Hospitals is aiming to defend its medical professionals and mitigate its financial liability, emphasizing the inherent risks in surgical procedures.
   Expert medical opinions from independent surgeons and hospital records, including surgical notes, post-operative charts, and internal review reports, will be critical evidence. The case highlights the complexities of medical malpractice litigation and the burden of proof in establishing negligence against healthcare providers.
