Case Name:
Patel & Sons Builders v. Residents Welfare Association, Green Acres

Citation:
(2023) 4 RERA App 101

Full Legal Case Text:
Patel & Sons Builders are facing a lawsuit from the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) of Green Acres residential complex concerning alleged structural defects and non-compliance with sanctioned building plans. The RWA claims that several common areas, including the clubhouse and swimming pool, were constructed with substandard materials and deviate significantly from the approved architectural designs, leading to safety concerns and aesthetic dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the RWA alleges that the builder failed to provide promised amenities, such as a dedicated children's play area and a functional rainwater harvesting system, which were explicitly advertised during the sales process. The builder, Patel & Sons, argues that minor deviations are permissible under construction norms and that the alleged defects are either cosmetic or a result of normal wear and tear. They also assert that some promised amenities were subject to market demand and feasibility, which changed during the project's execution.
   The primary legal issues involve the interpretation of the sale agreements, the applicability of RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) guidelines regarding construction quality and promised amenities, and the extent of the builder's liability for deviations. The RWA is seeking significant compensation for rectification costs, a court order for specific performance (completion of promised amenities), and punitive damages. Patel & Sons is aiming to limit its financial exposure and defend its reputation, arguing that the RWA's claims are exaggerated and an attempt to extract further concessions.
   Expert reports on structural integrity and building compliance are central to the evidence. The case could set a precedent for consumer protection in real estate and impact future builder-buyer agreements. The financial implications for Patel & Sons could be substantial, affecting their solvency and future projects.
