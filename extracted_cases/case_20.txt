Case Name:
Ms. Aarti Singh v. Matrimonial Disputes Court

Citation:
(2023) 2 Fam L (HC) 110

Full Legal Case Text:
Ms. Aarti Singh has filed a petition challenging an interim maintenance order issued by the Matrimonial Disputes Court, arguing that the ordered amount is insufficient to cover her basic living expenses and the educational needs of her minor child, given her estranged husband's substantial income. She claims that the court failed to adequately consider all sources of her husband's income and assets, and that the calculation was based on an outdated assessment of living costs. Her husband, Mr. Sameer Singh, contends that the interim maintenance is fair and reasonable, based on his declared income, and that Ms. Singh has exaggerated her expenses and has her own earning capacity which was not fully disclosed.
   The primary legal issues involve the principles governing interim maintenance awards in matrimonial disputes, the assessment of income and assets of parties, and the interpretation of family law provisions related to spousal and child support. Ms. Singh is seeking an upward revision of the interim maintenance amount. The court is defending its discretion in awarding maintenance and the fairness of its order.
   Financial statements, bank records, income tax returns, and affidavits of assets and liabilities will be crucial evidence. The case highlights the challenges in ensuring fair financial provisions in divorce and separation cases.
