Case Name:
Rajeshwari Devi v. Public Provident Fund Department

Citation:
(2023) 1 PFR (SC) 23

Full Legal Case Text:
Rajeshwari Devi has filed a writ petition challenging the Public Provident Fund (PPF) Department's refusal to disburse her deceased husband's PPF accumulation to her, despite her being the nominee. The Department has cited a discrepancy in the nominee's name as recorded in their system versus the death certificate and other identification documents. Ms. Devi claims that the discrepancy is minor, a clerical error, and that her identity as the legal heir and nominee is undisputed through other supporting documents, including an affidavit. The PPF Department, however, insists on strict adherence to its internal guidelines and regulations for nominee verification to prevent fraudulent claims, requiring a court order or further stringent verification for such discrepancies.
   The primary legal issues involve the interpretation of PPF scheme rules regarding nomination, the extent of a nominee's rights, and the balance between preventing fraud and facilitating legitimate claims. Ms. Devi is seeking a mandamus order directing the Department to disburse the funds without further delay. The Department is defending its cautious approach, emphasizing its duty to protect public funds.
   Relevant documents include the PPF account statement, nomination form, death certificate, and identity proofs. The case has implications for the accessibility of social security benefits and the challenges faced by ordinary citizens in navigating bureaucratic hurdles.
